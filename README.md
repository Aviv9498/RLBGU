## Solutions for homework in BGU RL Curse 372.2.5910  given by Gilad kats
- In assignment 1 we will get to know and experiment with OpenAI Gymnasium, a testbed
for reinforcement learning algorithms containing environments in different difficulty
levels. We will first implement a tabular Q-learning model on a simple environment in Qustion1 : "FrozenLake-v0".
Then in Qustions 2+3, We will move on to a larger scale environment, "CartPole-v1". In Question 2 we will use a NN function
approximator of the Q-value, using the basic DQN algorithm. In Question 3 will try to
improve DQN with one of the state-of the-art algorithms from recent years.
NN's are computed with tensorflow
